# Redux Records

### Overview

This is the second of a series of projects. My goal is to learn how to build reliable React apps using React and many of the tools in its ecosystem.

### The project

In react-records project I showed my record collection fetching the data from the Discogs API. In this project I want to introduce Redux to manage the state of the app.

Image requests to the Discogs API require authentication. To be able to see record covers is necessary to authenticate. Fill in _AUTH_TOKEN_ with a valid token in _src/data/api/utils_.
