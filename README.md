# React Records

### Overview

This is the first of a series of projects. My goal is to learn how to build reliable React apps, using React and many of the tools in its ecosystem.

### The project

I have a small record collection which I have cataloged in [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/). In this React app I show my collection fetching the data form the [Discogs RESTful API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/).

Image requests to the Discogs API require authentication. To be able to see record covers is necessary to authenticate. Fill in _AUTH_TOKEN_ with a valid token in _src/data/api/utils_.

### Covered concepts

- How to write components
- Client-side routing
- Interact with external API (with authentication)
- High order components (HOC)
- CSS modules
- CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox
- BEM

### Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
$ npm start
```

### Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
